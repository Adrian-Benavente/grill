# Grill

![Grill Logo](img/logo.png)

Grill is not another bootstrap, but a **mobile first**, **CSS only** framework based on Grid and written in Sass, intended for quickly making lay outs.
Many CSS frameworks out there do too much, my main goal is to keep it stripped-down to the minimum as much as possible.
